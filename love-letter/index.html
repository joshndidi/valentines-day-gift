                                     My love, these past eight months with you have been nothing short of magical. Time has flown by so quickly, and it’s hard to believe it’s already been eight months since you came into my life and made it so much brighter. They say time moves fast when you’re with the ones you love, but with you, it feels like time itself has a way of disappearing altogether. Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream, one where I don’t want to wake up because I don’t want to miss a single second with you. You’ve shown me what it’s like to be truly happy and I can’t thank you enough for that. These eight months have felt like just the beginning and I’m so excited to see what the rest of our lives together will bring. I think about all the milestones we’ll hit, the memories we’ll make, and the laughter we’ll share, and it makes me so grateful to have you as my partner.
                                        Ellie, you are, without a doubt, the most beautiful and perfect girl to ever exist. I don’t think I’ll ever stop being in awe of you. Your beauty is the kind that takes my breath away, the kind that could stop time. I don’t even know how to put it into words because it’s so beyond anything I’ve ever seen before. When I look into your eyes, I feel like I’m being pulled into the vastness of space. They’re not just beautiful—they’re mesmerizing. They’re like stars, galaxies, and universes all rolled into one, and every time I get lost in them, I feel like I’m discovering something new and amazing. Your eyes are the kind of beautiful that makes me believe in magic. They hold so much depth, so much emotion, and every time they meet mine it feels like the entire world fades away leaving just us. I could get lost in your eyes forever, and I would never be bored of it.
                                        And then there’s your hair, my baby, your beautifully curly, incredible hair. I know some men don’t appreciate curls the way they should, but honestly, they’re missing out on something truly extraordinary. Your curls are so unique, so radiant, and so undeniably you. I love everything about your hair, the way it frames your gorgeous face is just so perfectttt. Whether it’s done up to perfection or just left as it naturally falls, your hair always looks amazing to me. I know there are times when you don’t feel that way but let me tell you something: no matter how you see it your hair is perfect in my eyes. It’s soft, vibrant, and full of character just like you. I love how it reflects your personality in so many ways, how it’s a reminder of how beautifully unique you are. Your curls are a symbol of your individuality, and every time I see them, I’m reminded of just how lucky I am to have you in my life.
                                        Speaking of unique, Ellie, your eyebrows are nothing short of incredible. I know it might sound like a small thing, but to me, every little detail about you is worth talking about. Your eyebrows are so beautifully shaped, and they give your face such character and personality. I notice all the little things about you, my love, and I cherish every single one of them. Your eyebrows, your eyes, your hair—every feature of yours is perfect to me. I could spend hours admiring how everything about you comes together so effortlessly making you the most breathtaking person I’ve ever seen. And as much as I love your appearance it’s only one part of the many things that make you so incredible.
                                        And Ellie, your sweet messages are something I treasure more than I can even explain. The texts you send me whether it’s something simple or something heartfelt always light up my entire day. I love them so much to the point where I can’t even go to sleep without your good night message. It’s become a part of my routine a little piece of you that I hold onto at the end of every day. When I see your message pop up on my phone my heart fills with happiness knowing that you’re thinking of me. Your words are like a warm hug I don’t think I’ll ever stop loving how special they make me feel. Every time you send me a message, it’s like I get a little reminder of how loved I am, and it’s the most comforting, beautiful feeling in the world.
                                        And your body, my wifee, I don’t even know where to begin when it comes to how much I adore it. I know there are times when you might feel insecure or unsure about how you look but let me tell you this: your body is perfect. It’s incredible, stunning, and absolutely beautiful no matter what you might think about it. Every curve, every line, every part of you is amazing to me and I wouldn’t change a single thing. You are breathtaking from head to toe. I love everything about you, inside and out, and I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. To me, you are the most beautiful woman in the world and I hope you never forget that. Your body is a part of who you are and I love every single part of you because it’s you. You’re beautiful in ways that words can’t fully capture, and I’ll never stop reminding you of that.
                                        But my love, your beauty isn’t just skin deep. You’re not just the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen but you’re also the most amazing person I’ve ever met. Your personality is the kind of incredible that feels like it could light up the entire world. You are so comforting to be around. You have this way of making me feel completely at ease, like no matter what’s going on in my life, everything will be okay as long as you’re by my side. Being with you feels like coming home it’s safe, it’s warm, and it’s exactly where I’m meant to be. Whenever I’m with you, all my worries just melt away. You have this incredible ability to make everything better even when things feel impossible. You’re my home, My baby, my rock, and my everything. I can’t thank you enough for being that for me.
                                        And then there’s your sense of humour, Ellie. You are, without a doubt, the funniest person I know. Your jokes never fail to crack me up except for the back ones (but then again I can’t say anything about bad jokes). I find myself laughing at your jokes even hours or days after you’ve told them, and sometimes I even laugh about them when I’m lying in bed trying to fall asleep. Your humor is one of the things I love most about you, Ellie. It’s so uniquely you, and it’s one of the many reasons why being with you is so much fun. You have this incredible ability to find joy and laughter in even the simplest moments, and that’s something I’ll always admire about you. You bring so much light into my life, and I’ll never stop appreciating how much happiness you bring me.
                                        And Ellie, you’re not just beautiful and funny, you’re also so incredibly smart. I love how intelligent you are, how you’re always able to solve problems with such ease. You have this amazing way of looking at things from a different perspective, and it’s something I truly admire about you. I love how we’re able to learn from each other, how we challenge each other to grow and improve. Being with you has taught me so much, Ellie, and I hope I’ve been able to do the same for you. You inspire me to be better every single day, and I can’t thank you enough for that. Your mind is just as beautiful as your heart, and it’s one of the countless reasons why I love you.
                                        And then there are our yaps. I love how much we talk to each other, my love. No matter what the topic is, we always find a way to turn it into something meaningful or hilarious. I could listen to you talk forever, my love. Your voice is so soft, so soothing, so beautiful. Just hearing you talk after a stressful day is enough to make all my worries disappear. Your voice is like a melody, Ellie, one that I never want to stop hearing. It’s comforting, it’s calming, and it’s everything I need. The way you speak, the way you express yourself, it all makes me love you even more. And our deep convos from time to time which really makes us learn about each other and deepens my love for you so much no matter how deep it is.
                                        My baby, I feel so lucky to have you in my life. You are everything I’ve ever dreamed of and so much more. You are my heart, my soul, my everything. I never thought I’d find someone who could make me feel the way you do, but here you are, proving me wrong in the best way possible. You are my one and only, my forever, my future, and I love you more than words could ever express. What we have is so special and I know I’ll never find anything like it again.
                                        And I am so proud of you my love. I know how much you’ve been through, how many challenges you’ve faced and I admire you so much for everything you’ve overcome. You are so strong, so resilient and I am constantly in awe of you. No matter what life throws your way you face it with courage and grace and I know you’ll continue to do so because that’s just who you are. And I’ll always be there for you just like you’ve always been there for me. Through thick and thin, no matter what happens, I’ll stand by your side and support you in every way I can.
                                        Ellie, my wife, my baby, my love, I can’t even begin to describe how much I love you. I love you more than the size of the observable universe, and even that doesn’t feel like enough to capture how much you mean to me. I am so overjoyed to call you my future wife(even though we’re practically already married), to know that I get to spend the rest of my life with someone as amazing as you. I can’t believe I managed to get you, Ellie to win over someone as beautiful, kind, smart, and perfect as you. You are my everything, and I love you more than you could ever comprehend.
                                        Ellie, you are my everything, my light in the darkness, and the reason for every smile on my face. Thank you for being you, for loving me, and for letting me love you. I love you, My wife, more than anything in this world and beyond.
                                        You are my eternity, my forever, and the best decision I’ve ever made. When I think of our future, I see nothing but happiness, adventures, and love. I can’t wait to keep building our dreams together, to grow side by side, and to cherish every single moment. With you, life is not just lived, it’s celebrated, treasured, and felt in its most profound depth. Ellie, you are my everything, and I’ll spend my life showing you just how much you mean to me.
                                        You are the missing piece of my soul, the person who completes me in every way. With you, life feels brighter, richer, and more meaningful. I am endlessly grateful for you, Ellie, and I promise to cherish, love, and support you through everything life has in store for us. Here’s to forever, my love.
                                        And I promise you no-one or nothing Is breaking me away from you no matter what happens ill always be there for you to talk to or just to be there any day
