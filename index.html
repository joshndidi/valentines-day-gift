    <h1>Bye Ellie</h1>
    <p>if ur seeing this ur most like ellie,and to you i say that you did not truly grasp how i felt through the relationship. the poop joke wasn't a joke but an attempt to inform you about what may happen when you are laying in a hospital bed you and you cant move,the call with chris i never called him over i went to him as he called me as he js said. you have been a massive role in my life and i cannot belive you would js disregard me like that. same at the party the first thing is heard is "HES SO FINE",i never called any other girl beautiful out of respect for you and the damage that can do, imagine how i wouldve felt if i heard that. i was practically forced to speak w otto as i did not want to intrude on your convo. i did ask you that day multiple times if you were okay and you gave me a dry  "yh" istead of continuing the convo. Ik ive done some mistakes but so have you and we all have flaws.I did love you and i thought we were on good terms but your reposts js made me js rethink life. how can one person be so quiick to repost shit about their previous lover(thats if you loved me at all). i dont know if this was all fake or if you js wanted a rebound from padmae or whatever but js know, you do not truly know my pov as i pushed my hurt and feelings down to continue the relationship. Goodbye Ellie.</p>
